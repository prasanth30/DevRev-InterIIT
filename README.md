# AI Agent 007 :Tooling for success
The project aims to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models by enabling them to generate a specific set of tools in response to a given query or task. 
This challenge was presented as a problem statement during the DevRev at Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0.

## Problem Statement 
A Language model L has a set of tools T, and a user query Q is given. To answer query Q, we
need to use existing tools. You need to output the subset of tools to be used to answer the
query, the arguments that these tools should be called with, and how to compose the tools to
answer the query.
